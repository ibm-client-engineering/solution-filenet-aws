## Key Accomplishments

- In a collaborative effort between the customer and our Client Engineering team, we achieved a successful documentation and deployment of OpenLDAP into the customer's environment. 
- Through collaborative efforts between the customer and our dedicated Client Engineering team, we successfully deployed the FileNet Operator into the customer's AWS EKS environment.


## Challenges

- Different environment - To elaborate on the above point, we initially deployed FileNet FNCM to our own reference AWS EKS environment, but not every environment is created equal. This customer was running Kynverno as a cluster policy manager.
- Private registry - We had to identify all required images for FileNet including Postgres and OpenLDAP and provide a list for the customer. This was necessary so they could pre-stage their private repo as they were not allowing external traffic to the cluster.
- Cluster Privileges - This necessitated identifying what cluster privileges the customer had on their environment. 
- Resource Quotas - The cluster was created via an automated process that automatically sets namespace resource quotas. 
- Operator Image - The default image available did not set resource quotas for any temporary job container. This was submitted as an RFE as it was a blocker in this customer environment. 

## Lessons Learned

- Education - The biggest takeaway that proved to be the most advantageous was providing links to the customer to allow them to empower themselves with pre-learning of Kubernetes and AWS and using an AWS Sandbox to further their learning. This allowed us to hit the ground running when we went onsite.
- Active list of required cluster privileges - As pointed out in our Challenges, some elements of the FileNet operator installation required certain privileges to be available to the customer user. Identifying a thorough list and providing it to future customers would allow for fewer hangups when onsite.


## Action Items

- ReadOnlyRootFileSystem - FCN 5.5.10 has readOnlyRootFilesystem implemented as part of security improvements applied to the container image. This causes problems as the customer uses Dynatrace in their environment and these folders cannot be copied thus causing the setup jobs to fail when deploying the FileNet pods. For now we are asking the customer to disable Dynatrace.
- LDAP 


## Up Next
- Successfully deploying the CR to the FileNet operator
