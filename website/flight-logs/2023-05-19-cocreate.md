## Date
Flight Logs contain information relating to steps completed between 05/18-05/19

## Key Accomplishments
- Successfully edited the configuration information within the CR.  This information included fields under the sections 'shared_configuration', 'initialize_configuration', as well as the requested resources.

## Challenges
- CPE initialization failed
- After applying the new CR we received errors due to something preventing the Ingress from bootstrapping acce.  Whenever we would login to ACCE, we would be presented with a blank screen

## Lessons Learned


## Action Items
- Create a ticket with the dev team to see why we were receiving the errors we were observing.

## Up Next
- We need to understand what is preventing the CPE initialization/bootstrapping process and why we are being presented with a blank screen after logging into ACCE.
