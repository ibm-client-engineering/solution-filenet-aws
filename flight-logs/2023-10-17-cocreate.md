## Work in Progress
- Today the team continued to troubleshoot the cluster issues.
- The team tried adding the oneagent annotation to the CR and that (potentially) caused errors in the operator, stating a syntax error.
- Despite taking out the entry, the operator began to recreate the pods. The deployments had the annotation, but the init containers were still getting stuck on trying to copy DynaTrace folders, which means the agent was still getting injected.
## Currently Tracking
- The team will continue to investigate Dynatrace to determine if it is involved with the errors in the cluster.  
- The client's team is working on an alternative way of sending logs. Email is blocking the files.
- We will continue to work closely with IBM support.
## Next Steps
- The team will continue working to resolve the cluster issues in the next session.
