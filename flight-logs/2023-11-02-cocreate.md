## Work in Progress
- Today the team verified the java certs that were associated with Process Designer. 
- After the java certs were updated, the team was able to launch Process Designer.
- The team then walked the client through WSDL setup and configuration in FileNet.
## Currently Tracking
- While the team was able to get Process Designer working, the main error of FileNet being unable to connect to the web client persisted. The web client error appears to be a separate error and we are continuing to work with IBM support on this issue. 
## Next Steps
- The team will work to resolve the FileNet issue and move to resume use cases and demos.
