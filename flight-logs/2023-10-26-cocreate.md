## Work in Progress
- After upgrading the client's environment to version 5.5.11, the team verified the upgrade, and the pods are now in a healthy state.
- With IBM support on todayâ€™s session, the team recreated the FileNet error that we were previously encountering.
- The team gathered logs from the client's environment and will be working closely with support to evaluate the errors and logs.
## Currently Tracking
- We will continue to work closely with IBM support and have provided them logs of todayâ€™s session.
## Next Steps
- The team will work to resolve the FileNet issue and move to resume use cases and demos.
