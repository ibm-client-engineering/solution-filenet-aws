## Work in Progress
- Today the team continued to upgrade the clientâ€™s FileNet environment to version 5.5.11.
- During the session, the team was able to successfully update the operator.
- The team then updated the CR to reflect the new image tags and added the â€˜sc_disable_read_only_root_filesystemâ€™ variable.
## Currently Tracking
- The client is watching to see if the rolling update of the running pods is successful.
- We will continue to work closely with IBM support.
## Next Steps
- The team will assess the state of the cluster and move to resolve any remaining errors.
