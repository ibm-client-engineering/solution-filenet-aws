## Work in Progress
- With the help of IBM support the team continued to troubleshoot the FileNet Navigator issue.

- The team walked through using workflows within Process Designer.
- The team discussed upcoming use cases now that the major errors have been addressed.
## Currently Tracking
- The team will be prepping for upcoming use cases and will be preparing documentation on GitHub.
## Next Steps
