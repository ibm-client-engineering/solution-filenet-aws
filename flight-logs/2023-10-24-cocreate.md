## Work in Progress

- There were some errors while applying the update and the team spent time troubleshooting.
-The team encountered a resource error that appears to be the same error the team faced during initial setup.  
## Currently Tracking
- The team will investigate how the resource error was previously resolved and will attempt to implement the solution in the next session.
- We will continue to work closely with IBM support on these errors.
## Next Steps
- The team will continue working to upgrade the cluster in the next session.
