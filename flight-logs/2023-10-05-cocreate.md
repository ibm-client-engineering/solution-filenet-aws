## Work in Progress
- Today the team continued to troubleshoot the cluster issues.
- The team tried several troubleshooting steps including:
    - Scaling the cmis pods
    - Scaling the operator
    - Deleting and restarting pods in a crashloopbackoff
- While the CPE pods did come back, they began to experience issues later in the session.
- The errors persisted and the team grabbed multiple logs from today’s session.
## Currently Tracking
- The team thinks that there are underlying issues with the cluster that are unrelated to FileNet.
- The client's team noted they have a team member who they could work with to assist with troubleshooting the cluster and possibly join a future session.
- We will continue to work closely with IBM support and have provided them logs of today’s session.
## Next Steps
- The team will continue working to resolve the cluster issues in the next session.
