## Work in Progress
- With the help of IBM support, the team investigated network tracing using various browsers.
- The team noticed that creating a document with content resulted in an error, while an empty document did not.
- The team also verified the network policies within the cluster.
- The team then collected more logs for further troubleshooting.
## Currently Tracking
- We will continue to work closely with IBM support and have provided them logs of todayâ€™s session.
## Next Steps
- The team will work to resolve the FileNet issue and move to resume use cases and demos.
