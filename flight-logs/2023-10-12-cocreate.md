## Work in Progress
- Today the team continued to troubleshoot the cluster issues.
- The team increased the max connections for Postgres. However, the errors persisted.  
- The team collected more logs from todayâ€™s session.
- There was a discussion around Dynatrace. The team sees a `permission denied` error in the pods involving Dynatrace. We encountered issues with Dynatrace in previous sessions and it looks like it may have been reenabled. The team speculated that this could be causing issues.  
## Currently Tracking
- The team will continue to investigate Dynatrace to determine if it is involved with the errors in the cluster.  
- We will continue to work closely with IBM support and have provided them logs of todayâ€™s session.
## Next Steps
- The team will continue working to resolve the cluster issues in the next session.
