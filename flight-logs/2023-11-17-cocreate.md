## Work in Progress
- The team scaled the FNCM operator down to 0 and set readOnlyRootFilesystem to false in the IER deployment directly.
- The team then added explicit Dynatrace annotations to the IER deployment that were supposed to disable the agent injection.
- We then modified the daemonset for Dynatrace to scale it to 0. After applying this change, the IER pods came online. 
## Currently Tracking
- The client will verify the IER pod comes up again after scaling the FNCM operator back up.
## Next Steps
- The team will examine the state of the IER deployment and will move to resume use cases and demos.
