## Work in Progress
- With the help of IBM support, the team checked the settings of the Advanced Storage Area and devices.
- The team noticed FileNet had 3 virtual servers listed but there were only 2 replicas. The team tried scaling to 3 replicas, however the error persisted.
- The team then gathered logs from process designer for further investigation.
## Currently Tracking
- We will continue to work closely with IBM support and have provided them logs of todayâ€™s session.
## Next Steps
- The team will work to resolve the FileNet issue and move to resume use cases and demos.
