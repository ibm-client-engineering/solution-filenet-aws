## Work in Progress
- While examining the logs, the team noticed an error 413 ‚Äúpayload too large‚Äù associated with NGINX.
- So, during this session, the team added a NGINX annotation within the CR to fix this error.
- After some testing, the team was successfully able to add content to a document and no longer encountered the web client error.
## Currently Tracking
- The team started troubleshooting FileNet Navigator. Navigator wont launch after login. This seems to be tied to a ingress error.  
- The team is gathering logs from this session and will work closely with IBM support on this issue.
## Next Steps
- The team will work to resolve the FileNet Navigator issue and move to resume use cases and demos.
