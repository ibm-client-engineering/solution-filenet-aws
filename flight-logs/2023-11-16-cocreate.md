## Work in Progress
- The team continued working on the IER deployment.
- The IER pods were in a failed state, but after further investigation it appears DynaTrace is causing the issue.
- The team collected logs from this session and opened a case on the issue.
- The team then walked through some Workflow functionality.
## Currently Tracking
- The team has opened a case and will be working closely with IBM support to resolve this issue.
## Next Steps
- The team will continue to work to get the IER deployment up and running.
