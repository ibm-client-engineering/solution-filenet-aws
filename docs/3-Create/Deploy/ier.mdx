## Deploy IER

If IBM Enterprise Records is required, you should have already staged the image per the previous instructions in Staging.

### Create the `ibm-ier-secret`

If deploying IER, create the following
 ```tsx
kubectl create secret generic ibm-ier-secret \
--from-literal=appLoginUsername="cpadmin" \
--from-literal=appLoginPassword="Password" \
--from-literal=keystorePassword="p@ssw0rd" \
--from-literal=ltpaPassword="p@ssw0rd"
```
### Updating CR for IER deployment

In the filenet CR you used to deploy the cluster, make the following changes and additions:
```yaml
  content_optional_components:
    cpe: true
    graphql: true
    cmis: false
    css: false
    es: false
    tm: false
    ban: true
    // highlight-start
    ier: true
    // highlight-end

```
After the `navigator_configuration` entry in the CR, add the following section
```yaml
  ier_configuration:
    arch:
      amd64: "3 - Most preferred"
    replica_count: 2
    ier_ext_tls_secret_name:
    ier_auth_ca_secret_name:
    image:
      // highlight-start
      # This should point to whatever repo you staged the image in. Leave this as default if using IBM's registry
      repository: cp.icr.io/cp/cp4a/ier/ier
      // highlight-end
      tag: ga-5218-ier-if005
      pull_policy: IfNotPresent
      // highlight-start
      # This NEEDS to be set to the correct secret name. Make sure it's the one you created above.
    ier_secret_name: ibm-ier-secret
      // highlight-end
    log:

        failure_threshold: 6
```

### Apply the CR
 
```bash
kubectl apply -f ibm_fncm_cr_production.yaml
```

Wait for about five minutes or so and then check to see if the pod has spun up.
 
```tsx
kubectl get pods

![RECORD](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/0ed9d858-3407-4194-b8b8-f4d80cd1363b)


## Managing Records


      Creating an Advanced dispostion schedule - 

There are two distinct types of disposition schedules available for your use.Basic dispostion schedule and Advanced dispostion schedule.

A Basic disposition schedule is the first. A basic schedule is a record category that specifies the retention period and the retention trigger property (event).
The value of using a Basic disposition schedule is faster time to process dispositions and less complexity in defining the schedule specifics.


An Advanced disposition schedule contains the retention period, the cut off trigger event (when the clock starts ticking), record phases and disposal instructions.
An administrator can associate a disposition schedule with one or more record categories, record folders or record types.
A record folder can have its own disposition schedule, or it can inherit the disposition schedule associated with a parent record category.


In a disposition schedule, an administrator will specify the retention rules for records and instructions for disposing of records at the end of the retention period.
 Disposition instructions and workflows include -

• Review

• Transfer to an archive for permanent preservation

• Export to another location

• Destroy (with approval)

• Auto-destroy

Below are the steps how to create a dispostion schedule.

1- Navigate to IER desktop and click on Configuration Tab. Select "Advanced Dispostion Schedules" from dropdown as shown below.


![Dispostion](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/39827486-20a0-4584-a0ce-5eef86065f83)


2- Click "Add Dispostion Schedule" to create a new dispostion schedule 


![AddDispostion](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/d89728ab-3e1e-40be-9e62-6b89d06bd33c)


3- Now we need to enter the properties for the dispostion schedule as shown below example 


![DispostionProp](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/59b49906-74de-4d6e-8262-a2913bc0033f)


4- Scroll down on dispostion schedule page.You can see the "Contract dispostion" added like below


![DispostionSchedule](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/a7cdeb64-4e1a-4ff3-abf6-20a621b3fc22)

5- A new dispostion schedule is scuessfully added to the list 



      Applying and executing disposition schedule - 

Disposition is normally executed on an automated schedule basis. There may be times that, as a Records Administrator, you would want to apply and execute a disposition schedule manually.
Although this is not the most common mechanism for executing a disposition schedule, it can be done if the need arises. 

1- Click on the top navigator icon on left corner and navigate to "File Plans" 


![FilePlan](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/d20f11e4-66cf-4811-8e88-78f189dab931)


2- Navigate to record category and clcik "Add Record Category" . Below is a screenshot for reference.

![RecordCategory](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/77320014-36ea-4fa3-a051-d853fdc12e43)


3- Fill in recordcategory properties as shown in below example and click "Add" button

![RecordProp](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/691b190a-7a61-4adf-abdf-73aff3ba10b4)


4- Now the records category with DateCreated is visible .Below is a refrence screenshot.

![DispostionInstruction](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/79cc265e-25b7-4be9-afd2-571eeb7aff85)

5- Re-classify previous manually declared record to new Record category.Below is an example to refer.

![Classifyrecord](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/14e93a1b-a4bf-4f46-93aa-0055b36700ff)

in Move Record plan enter "2023 Compliance Rule" and the new record category . Click Move . Below is a screenshot to refer.

![MoveRecord](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/d61b1f41-946f-4315-ba19-1fd8a3e69e86)

You can now see the under record category like below. 

![RecordMoved](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/26e81b8c-e718-41f9-9e7d-6c6eb1e6a381)


6- Now we can run the dispostion sweep to prepare above record gategory for dispostion. 

      On top left Navigator click on "Tasks" and Click on Schedule > Schedule Basic Dispostion Sweep and shown below


![DispostionSweep](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/9bb0887a-292e-4aa3-a16f-1612f3812b67)


Select FPOS and fill in details as shown in refrence screenshot and Schedule Sweep


![FPOS](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/4e3ff62b-08a5-40da-98a8-18f727e19ac0)

## Appendix

### Applying fix for IER
:::info
As of 23.0.x release of CP4BA, the following bug was introduced into IBM FileNet Content Manager:

When trying to access the IBM Enterprise Records desktop, an error message says that you cannot connect to the web client.
The log also shows that an exception was thrown "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org.apache.xerces.xni.parser.XMLEntityResolver".

Cause:
After moving to Java 11, IERApplicationPlugin.jar is unable to resolve the path to XercesImpl.jar in the ICN container.

Tracked in this [link](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-cloud-pak-business-automation-230x-known-limitations#I42202)

The following instructions handle addressing this missing jar file.
:::

We have included the required files here.
- [ier-library.xml](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/blob/main/static/deployment_files/ExtraJars/ier-library.xml)
- [xercesImpl-2.12.2.jar](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/blob/main/static/deployment_files/ExtraJars/xercesImpl-2.12.2.jar)

Keep in mind that future releases of CP4BA and FileNet may not require this fix to be applied. This is currently only applicable to 23.0.1.

Determine the navigator pod with the following command:
```tsx
kubectl get pods
NAME                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

// highlight-next-line
fncmdeploy-navigator-deploy-58b9c95c4-kt6jc   1/1     Running   0          3d9h
fncmdeploy-tm-deploy-7d4fd64759-x28qw         1/1     Running   0          12d

```

Create the `ier-jars` subdirectory on the navigator pod:

```tsx
kubectl exec -it fncmdeploy-navigator-deploy-58b9c95c4-kt6jc -- mkdir configDropins/overrides/ier-jars
```

Upload the `ier-library.xml` and the `xercesImpl-2.12.2.jar` to that subdirectory on the navigator pod.

```tsx
kubectl cp ier-library.xml fncmdeploy-navigator-deploy-58b9c95c4-kt6jc:configDropins/overrides/
kubectl cp xercesImpl-2.12.2.jar fncmdeploy-navigator-deploy-58b9c95c4-kt6jc:configDropins/overrides/ier-jars/xercesImpl.jar
```

Scale the navigator deployment down and up. If your replicas are more that 1, scale appropriately.

```tsx
kubectl scale deploy fncmdeploy-navigator-deploy --replicas=0
kubectl scale deploy fncmdeploy-navigator-deploy --replicas=1
```
