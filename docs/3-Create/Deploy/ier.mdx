## Deploy IER

If IBM Enterprise Records is required, you should have already staged the image per the previous instructions in Staging.

### Create the `ibm-ier-secret`

If deploying IER, create the following
 ```tsx
kubectl create secret generic ibm-ier-secret \
--from-literal=appLoginUsername="cpadmin" \
--from-literal=appLoginPassword="Password" \
--from-literal=keystorePassword="p@ssw0rd" \
--from-literal=ltpaPassword="p@ssw0rd"
```

### Create the config map `fncmdeploy-tm-custom-env`

This step is required when deploying IER to the cluster. Task Manager pods require the `TM_JOB_URL` env variable to point to the location of the IER plugin.

```tsx title="fncmdeploy-tm-custom-env.yaml"
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: fncmdeploy-tm-custom-env
  labels:
    app: fncmdeploy-tm-custom-env
data:
  TM_JOB_URL: "https://fncmdeploy-ier-svc:9443/EnterpriseRecordsPlugin/IERApplicationPlugin.jar"
```
In our case, the TM_JOB_URL referenced [here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/enterprise-records/5.2.1?topic=in-configuring-content-navigator-task-manager-enterprise-records#frmco011__1)
needs to point to the internal service URL, not the external URL as it does not exist.

This is also a custom env variable for Task Manager that we will enable in the CR below.

Apply it to the cluster
```bash
kubectl apply -f fncmdeploy-tm-custom-env.yaml
```

### Update the CR for Task Manager

In the filenet CR you used to deploy the cluster, make the following changes and additions:

Under the Task Manager application block in the CR add the `custom_configmap` to point to the config map we just created. Also make sure the `security_roles_to_group_mapping` are set to `cpadmins` and `cpusers` as these are the groups that exist in LDAP.

```tsx
        // highlight-start
        custom_configmap:
         - name: fncmdeploy-tm-custom-env
           is_env: true
        // highlight-end
        # - name: <name of configmap>
        #   volume_path:  # optional

        ## All users/groups belong to one of three roles (Admin, User, or Auditor) that are specific to Task Manager.
        ## Each role takes a list of users/groups (e.g., groups: [taskAdmins, taskAdmins2]).  Refer to Knowledge Center documentation for details.
        security_roles_to_group_mapping:
          task_admins:
        // highlight-next-line
            groups: [cpadmins]
            users: []
          task_users:
        // highlight-next-line
            groups: [cpusers]
            users: []
          task_auditors:
        // highlight-next-line
            groups: [cpadmins]
            users: []
```

### Updating CR for IER deployment

In the filenet CR you used to deploy the cluster, make the following changes and additions:
```yaml
  content_optional_components:
    cpe: true
    graphql: true
    cmis: false
    css: false
    es: false
    tm: true
    ban: true
    // highlight-start
    ier: true
    // highlight-end

```
After the `navigator_configuration` entry in the CR, add the following section
```yaml
  ier_configuration:
    arch:
      amd64: "3 - Most preferred"
    replica_count: 2
    ier_ext_tls_secret_name:
    ier_auth_ca_secret_name:
    image:
      // highlight-start
      # This should point to whatever repo you staged the image in. Leave this as default if using IBM's registry
      repository: cp.icr.io/cp/cp4a/ier/ier
      // highlight-end
      tag: ga-5218-ier-if005
      pull_policy: IfNotPresent
      // highlight-start
      # This NEEDS to be set to the correct secret name. Make sure it's the one you created above.
    ier_secret_name: ibm-ier-secret
      // highlight-end
    log:
      format: json
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 500m

        period_seconds: 5
        timeout_seconds: 5
        failure_threshold: 6
```

### Uploading config jars to the Task Manager pod

Before we apply the modified CR, let's prepare the Task Manager pod.

The following files are required for the Task Manager pod:
- [`Jace.jar`](/deployment_files/IER_config/Jace.jar)
- [`pe.jar`](/deployment_files/IER_config/pe.jar)
- [`peResources.jar`](/deployment_files/IER_config/peResources.jar)
- [`TM-Liberty.xml`](/deployment_files/IER_config/TM-Liberty.xml)

The above files and how to get them are referenced [here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/enterprise-records/5.2.1?topic=in-configuring-content-navigator-task-manager-enterprise-records#frmco011__1), but we've included them in our repo.

Retrieve the name of your existing Task Manager pod

```tsx
kubectl get pods | grep tm-deploy
//highlight-next-line
fncmdeploy-tm-deploy-9db6b7f7f-6zzjb          1/1     Running   0          5d20h
```

Push the jars downloaded above to the `configDropins/overrides` directory on the Task Manager pod.

```tsx
kubectl cp Jace.jar fncmdeploy-tm-deploy-9db6b7f7f-6zzjb:configDropins/overrides
kubectl cp pe.jar fncmdeploy-tm-deploy-9db6b7f7f-6zzjb:configDropins/overrides
kubectl cp peResources.jar fncmdeploy-tm-deploy-9db6b7f7f-6zzjb:configDropins/overrides
```

Push up the `TM-Liberty.xml` file to `configDropins/overrides`
```tsx
kubectl cp TM-Liberty.xml fncmdeploy-tm-deploy-9db6b7f7f-6zzjb:configDropins/overrides
```



### Apply the CR
 
```bash
kubectl apply -f ibm_fncm_cr_production.yaml
```

Wait for about five minutes or so and then check to see if the pod has spun up.
 
```tsx
kubectl get pods
NAME                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

```

## IER Configuration 


IBM Enterprise Records (IER) works in conjunction with FileNet Content Manager to provide the foundation for an enterprise compliance platform.
Below diagram is a presentation how the content in FileNet Content Manager and the record objects work together.

![Design](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/99fc2f22-93c4-4ca9-89a9-e44599fd1553)


On the left side is a folder in FileNet Content Manager that is in a record-enabled FileNet object store.
On the right side is a special object store that contains the record objects. This is called a File Plan Object Store.


[Create the following objects stores](/Create/Deploy/solution-deploy-operator#adding-object-stores) and configure them as mentioned. These are the prerequisite for IER Functaionality to work correctly.

1. ROS - Object Store 

      [Configure connection points](/Create/Deploy/solution-deploy-workflow#creating-a-workflow-system-and-connection-point-within-filenet) for ROS. Below is a screenshot for reference 

![ROS](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-processmining/assets/136734452/07ac22da-b1fa-4e32-98ec-ac5f0b69d617)


2. FPOS - Object Store 

     Validate the FPOS object store is created:

![FPOS](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-processmining/assets/136734452/46a43cb7-bed4-479c-88b0-6459a962fef1)



3. In the acce console create a CodeModules folder:

![CodeModule](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/7fd4b69c-c98d-47c9-b705-20f35514816b)




4. IER Task Manager Setup Configuration

      Configuring Task Manager for IER in ICN - In the systems content navigator administration interface go to the settings node:

![TMSetting](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/84f03641-1390-4516-b032-36d8d52a9f28)


Scroll down in the general tab under settings to Task Manager configuration and fill in the following:
- Enable the task manager service
- Enter the task manager url
  - This is the URL uing which other applications can comunicate with TM
  - e.g. - _http_ or _https_  _://ServerName:Portnumber/taskManagerWeb/api/V1._
    - ServerName =
      - _ServiceName_ if the IER pod is in the same namespace
      - _ServiceName.Namespace_ if the IER pod is in another namespace
- Specify the log diretcory


![TMConfig](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/e1b091b4-d11d-497e-8717-1f2cb6cb775d)


Add the TM_JOB_URL environment variable to the Task Manager deployment: [Task Manager in Container](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/enterprise-records/5.2.1?topic=in-configuring-content-navigator-task-manager-enterprise-records#frmco011__1)


5. IER Configuration on ICN 


Log in to ICN and navigate to Plugins and create a _New Plug-in_:

![AddPlugin](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/5d96ce91-7660-4fb2-a9d0-d8d5e6d86ec7)




Add JAR file path and hit load. It will look like this:

![ICNPLUGIN](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/d8288174-bfd7-4c9b-ac78-67faa6dd7b4f)

Save and Close. Edit the added plugin and scroll down. You will see the file plan repository like this and select Connect and then Click on the FPOS:

![ICNFILEPLANREPO](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/1b23d73e-ba89-4daa-8ca2-0ec7839c77a8)

Create a desktop IER and select repository FPOS.

Navigate to Repository Tab (_General_ -> _Authentication_ -> _Repository_) and add FPOS and ROS like it is shown below:
![ICNREPO](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/f2126b91-d000-45d2-80c6-202d64ab9232)

Login to IER desk top and navigate to administration. IER desk top will be visible under desktops and FPOS repository would be visible under Repositories

IER desk top will have the options shown below:

 ![IERDESKTOP](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/252b6535-f740-4b63-b4c1-551afc79d0bd)

Create a custom menu - Copy Document Context Menu and add the IER option as shown below:
![CUSTOMMENU](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/3460c13e-e64e-46db-b669-e5239c8f9763)
Add the menu to the desktop where IER functionality is exceted. Below is the image where you can add the custom menu created on above step:
![CUSTOMMENU1](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/c793b329-9e98-4d55-a3ac-80b7c7fe4055)


## Profile Creation

Prerequsites :

1.File Plan Object Store is created

2.Record Object Store is created

3.Connection Point for IER is created 

To start Configuration Manager use below commands . _ier_install_path_  is the location where IBM Enterprise Record is installed.


<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">
```bash

ier_install_path\configure\configmgr.exe

```

## Appendix

### Applying fix for IER
:::info
As of 23.0.x release of CP4BA, the following bug was introduced into IBM FileNet Content Manager:

When trying to access the IBM Enterprise Records desktop, an error message says that you cannot connect to the web client.
The log also shows that an exception was thrown "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org.apache.xerces.xni.parser.XMLEntityResolver".

Cause:
After moving to Java 11, IERApplicationPlugin.jar is unable to resolve the path to XercesImpl.jar in the ICN container.

Tracked in this [link](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-cloud-pak-business-automation-230x-known-limitations#I42202)

The following instructions handle addressing this missing jar file.
:::

We have included the required files here.
- [ier-library.xml](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/blob/main/static/deployment_files/ExtraJars/ier-library.xml)
- [xercesImpl-2.12.2.jar](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/blob/main/static/deployment_files/ExtraJars/xercesImpl-2.12.2.jar)

Keep in mind that future releases of CP4BA and FileNet may not require this fix to be applied. This is currently only applicable to 23.0.1.

Determine the navigator pod with the following command:
```tsx
kubectl get pods
NAME                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
fncmdeploy-cmis-deploy-654774fd5f-5xtnr       1/1     Running   0          12d
fncmdeploy-cpe-deploy-7d7dbffc94-n86tt        1/1     Running   0          9d
fncmdeploy-css-deploy-1-66bbd484b-qzrl9       1/1     Running   0          12d
fncmdeploy-es-deploy-58f9659b8b-klmjh         1/1     Running   0          12d
fncmdeploy-graphql-deploy-775766b99d-cx899    1/1     Running   0          12d
fncmdeploy-ier-deploy-6f7465cd5d-sxp9d        1/1     Running   0          6d8h
// highlight-next-line
fncmdeploy-navigator-deploy-58b9c95c4-kt6jc   1/1     Running   0          3d9h
fncmdeploy-tm-deploy-7d4fd64759-x28qw         1/1     Running   0          12d
ibm-fncm-operator-748884b478-qkd4f            1/1     Running   0          10d
postgres-759fd876ff-d5fxd                     1/1     Running   0          12d
```

Create the `ier-jars` subdirectory on the navigator pod:

```tsx
kubectl exec -it fncmdeploy-navigator-deploy-58b9c95c4-kt6jc -- mkdir configDropins/overrides/ier-jars
```

Upload the `ier-library.xml` and the `xercesImpl-2.12.2.jar` to that subdirectory on the navigator pod.

```tsx
kubectl cp ier-library.xml fncmdeploy-navigator-deploy-58b9c95c4-kt6jc:configDropins/overrides/
kubectl cp xercesImpl-2.12.2.jar fncmdeploy-navigator-deploy-58b9c95c4-kt6jc:configDropins/overrides/ier-jars/xercesImpl.jar
```

Scale the navigator deployment down and up. If your replicas are more that 1, scale appropriately.

```tsx
kubectl scale deploy fncmdeploy-navigator-deploy --replicas=0
kubectl scale deploy fncmdeploy-navigator-deploy --replicas=1
```

## Troubleshoot

### On Configuration Manager

If you see this error when running the Configure File Plan Object Store task:
```
Starting to run Configure File Plan Object Store

Configure File Plan Object Store *************************
Finished running Configure File Plan Object Store
An error occurred while running Configure File Plan Object Store
Running the task failed with the following message: A network error occurred when processing a Web service request or response. See the nested exception for specific details. See full stack trace for details.  Message: Unexpected end of file from server Duration 50,063 milliseconds.
```

Workaround:
Update config of `server.xml` in the CPE pod, add a timeout for 10m:
```
cat server.xml
```

```
<server>
<httpEndpoint id="defaultHttpEndpoint"
readTimeout="10m"
host="*"
httpPort="9080"
httpsPort="9443"
protocolVersion="http/1.1">
<httpOptions PurgeDataDuringClose="true" />
</httpEndpoint>
</server>
```

### On deploying IER (IER pod doesn't start properly or it starts but getting ssl related error)

If your IER pod doesn't start:
```
Unable to attach or mount volumes: unmounted volumes=[custom-config-volume ier-custom-keystore-volume], unattached volumes=[], failed to process volumes=[]: timed out waiting for the condition
```

OR IER pod running ok but you see some SSL related error prevent IER engine to start:
```
[ERROR ] CWWKS9582E: The [cssSSLSettings] sslRef attributes required by the orb element with the defaultOrb id have not been resolved within 10 seconds. As a result, the applications will not start. Ensure that you have included a keyStore element and that Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is configured correctly. If the sslRef is defaultSSLConfig, then add a keyStore element with the id defaultKeyStore and a password.
```

There is a workaround by manually uploading the plugin.jar to pod:

1. Copy `IERApplicationPlugin.jar` from the latest IER fixpack.

2. log onto Openshift and retrieve navigator pod:
```
oc get pods | grep fncmdeploy-navigator

fncmdeploy-navigator-deploy-f64db4b8f-jj44k   1/1     Running   1 (18d ago)   18d
```

3. Upload IER plugin jar to plug-in store:
```
oc cp IERApplicationPlugin.jar fncmdeploy-navigator-deploy-f64db4b8f-jj44k:/opt/ibm/plugins
```

4. upload IER plugin jar to Task Manager pod: configdropin/overrrides & :/opt/ibm/extTM:
```
oc get pod | grep navigator
```

```
oc cp IERApplicationPlugin.jar fncmdeploy-tm-deploy-854595dfcd-ptwm6:configDropins/overrides
oc cp IERApplicationPlugin.jar fncmdeploy-tm-deploy-854595dfcd-ptwm6:/opt/ibm/extTM
```

### On Content Navigator (when declaring FPOS as File Plan repository)

If you see error when declaring FPOS as File Plan repository:

1. Create a file named ier-library.xml containing:

```
<server>
  <library id="FileNetLib">
    <fileset dir="${server.config.dir}/configDropins/overrides/ier-jars" includes="*.jar" scanInterval="5s" />
  </library>
</server>
```

2. Copy `xercesImpl-2.12.2.jar` from `<IER_install_path>/API/JARM`

3. Navigate to your navigator pod, cd to `/opt/ibm/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/configDropins/overrides` and create a folder:
```
mkdir ier-jars
```

4. Then upload the files from local machine to pod:
```
oc cp ier-library.xml fncmdeploy-navigator-deploy-f64db4b8f-25xz5:/opt/ibm/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/configDropins/overrides

oc cp xercesImpl-2.12.2.jar fncmdeploy-navigator-deploy-f64db4b8f-25xz5::/opt/ibm/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/configDropins/overrides/ier-jars/
```
