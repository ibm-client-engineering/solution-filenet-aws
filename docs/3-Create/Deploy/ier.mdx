## Deploy IER

If IBM Enterprise Records is required, you should have already staged the image per the previous instructions in Staging.

### Create the `ibm-ier-secret`

If deploying IER, create the following
 ```tsx
kubectl create secret generic ibm-ier-secret \
--from-literal=appLoginUsername="cpadmin" \
--from-literal=appLoginPassword="Password" \
--from-literal=keystorePassword="p@ssw0rd" \
--from-literal=ltpaPassword="p@ssw0rd"
```
### Updating CR for IER deployment

In the filenet CR you used to deploy the cluster, make the following changes and additions:
```yaml
  content_optional_components:
    cpe: true
    graphql: true
    cmis: false
    css: false
    es: false
    tm: false
    ban: true
    // highlight-start
    ier: true
    // highlight-end

```
After the `navigator_configuration` entry in the CR, add the following section
```yaml
  ier_configuration:
    arch:
      amd64: "3 - Most preferred"
    replica_count: 2
    ier_ext_tls_secret_name:
    ier_auth_ca_secret_name:
    image:
      // highlight-start
      # This should point to whatever repo you staged the image in. Leave this as default if using IBM's registry
      repository: cp.icr.io/cp/cp4a/ier/ier
      // highlight-end
      tag: ga-5218-ier-if005
      pull_policy: IfNotPresent
      // highlight-start
      # This NEEDS to be set to the correct secret name. Make sure it's the one you created above.
    ier_secret_name: ibm-ier-secret
      // highlight-end
    log:
      format: json

```

### Apply the CR
 
```bash
kubectl apply -f ibm_fncm_cr_production.yaml
```

Wait for about five minutes or so and then check to see if the pod has spun up.
 
```tsx
kubectl get pods

## IER Configuration 


IBM Enterprise Records (IER) works in conjunction with FileNet Content Manager to provide the foundation for an enterprise compliance platform.
Below diagram is a presentation how the content in FileNet Content Manager and the record objects work together.

![Design](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/99fc2f22-93c4-4ca9-89a9-e44599fd1553)


On the left side is a folder in FileNet Content Manager that is in a record-enabled FileNet object store.
On the right side is a special object store that contains the record objects. This is called a File Plan Object Store.


      Please make sure below object stores are created and mentioned configurations are in place.These are the prerequisite for IER Functaionality to work correctly.

1. ROS - Object Store 

      Configure connection points for ROS. Below is a screenshot for reference 

![ROS](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-processmining/assets/136734452/07ac22da-b1fa-4e32-98ec-ac5f0b69d617)


2. FPOS - Object Store 

     Validate FPOS object store is created shown in Screenshot below

![FPOS](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-processmining/assets/136734452/46a43cb7-bed4-479c-88b0-6459a962fef1)



3. In Acce console create Code Module as shown below 

![CodeModule](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/7fd4b69c-c98d-47c9-b705-20f35514816b)




4. IER Task Manager Setup Configuration

      Configuring Task Manager for IER in ICN - In the systems content navigator administration interface go to the settings node.


 Below are refrence screenshots.

## Appendix

### Applying fix for IER
:::info
As of 23.0.x release of CP4BA, the following bug was introduced into IBM FileNet Content Manager:

When trying to access the IBM Enterprise Records desktop, an error message says that you cannot connect to the web client.
The log also shows that an exception was thrown "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org.apache.xerces.xni.parser.XMLEntityResolver".

Cause:
After moving to Java 11, IERApplicationPlugin.jar is unable to resolve the path to XercesImpl.jar in the ICN container.

Tracked in this [link](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-cloud-pak-business-automation-230x-known-limitations#I42202)

The following instructions handle addressing this missing jar file.
:::

We have included the required files here.
- [ier-library.xml](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/blob/main/static/deployment_files/ExtraJars/ier-library.xml)
- [xercesImpl-2.12.2.jar](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/blob/main/static/deployment_files/ExtraJars/xercesImpl-2.12.2.jar)

Keep in mind that future releases of CP4BA and FileNet may not require this fix to be applied. This is currently only applicable to 23.0.1.

Determine the navigator pod with the following command:
```tsx
kubectl get pods
NAME                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

```

Create the `ier-jars` subdirectory on the navigator pod:

```tsx
kubectl exec -it fncmdeploy-navigator-deploy-58b9c95c4-kt6jc -- mkdir configDropins/overrides/ier-jars
```

Upload the `ier-library.xml` and the `xercesImpl-2.12.2.jar` to that subdirectory on the navigator pod.

```tsx
kubectl cp ier-library.xml fncmdeploy-navigator-deploy-58b9c95c4-kt6jc:configDropins/overrides/
kubectl cp xercesImpl-2.12.2.jar fncmdeploy-navigator-deploy-58b9c95c4-kt6jc:configDropins/overrides/ier-jars/xercesImpl.jar
```

Scale the navigator deployment down and up. If your replicas are more that 1, scale appropriately.

```tsx
kubectl scale deploy fncmdeploy-navigator-deploy --replicas=0
kubectl scale deploy fncmdeploy-navigator-deploy --replicas=1
```
