## FileNet Workflows

## Setup Components

### Standalone Process Designer

#### Version info
- IBM Content Platform Engine - 5.5.11.0
- IBM Content Navigator 3.0.14

#### Prerequisites
- A [Java Runtime Environment](https://www.java.com/en/download/) (JRE 1.8 or newer)
- [Add Java to PATH](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/b2b-integrator/6.0.2?topic=installation-setting-java-variables)
- Install the Filenet Content Manager CPE tools package from IBM Passport Advantage using the part number `M0CTDML`

#### Setup Steps

##### Creating a Workflow System and Connection Point within Filenet
1. Open up and log into the acce console.
2. Open the Object Store in which you want to store Workflow data.
3. Click on _Administrative->Workflow_ System.
4. Click New.
5. Under _Table Spaces -> Data_, enter the tablespace where you want workflow files to be stored. &emsp;&emsp; _Note: see [Create Databases](https://ibm-client-engineering.github.io/solution-filenet-aws/Create/solution-deploy/#create-databases) for the tablespaces configuration, including their names._
6. Under _Workflow System Security Groups -> Administration Group_, enter the admin group you want to assign to the Workflow System. These two can be found in your filenet configuration within the CR. &emsp;&emsp; _Note: see [Deploying CR](https://ibm-client-engineering.github.io/solution-filenet-aws/Create/solution-deploy/#deploying-cr). The admin group is specified under_ `initialize_configuration: ic_ldap_admins_groups_name` in the CR.
7. Continue through the steps, adding Connection Point and Isolated Region names and enter the _Isolated Region Number_ (1 if it’s your first in this object store, and so on).
8. If you wish, you can _Specify Isolated Region Table Space (Optional)_.
9. Review all the details and click _Finish_.
10. Navigate to _Workflow System->Connection Points_ to confirm that it was successfully created:

##### SSL Configuration (adding the site certificate into the jre keystore)
1. Launch [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
2. Navigate to the ACCE console
3. Click on the following- 

- The _Lock Icon_ on the left side of the url:

![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/dfb9f7d5-12b9-42ee-8ced-376e2772ac48)

- _Connection is secure_:

![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/e0855502-5992-4a16-9e66-e061f298a4e6)

- _Certificate is valid_, _Details_ and then _Export..._:

![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/857a7863-5d60-4822-acea-b7d111065669)

4. Export **full certificate chain** (usually the second option in Save as) and **change extension to .crt** instead of .cert:

![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/0b848a56-7cd9-43bb-b44c-32dc49fe35b5)

5. Run the appropriate command to import it into your JRE keystore (keystore tool is found in the JAVA HOME directory under the bin folder)
  - Windows:
`..\..\bin\keytool -import -keystore ..\..\lib\security\cacerts -file cpe_websphere_ssl_cert.crt`
  - Mac/Linux:
`../../bin/keytool -import -keystore ../../lib/security/cacerts -file cpe_websphere_ssl_cert.crt`
6. When prompted with _Trust this certificate? [no]_, respond with _yes_
7. You should see an `added to keystore` message

_Note:_
If you are importing a key again, you may encounter the following error: &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
`keytool error: java.lang.Exception: Certificate not imported, alias <mykey> already exists`

In which case you must delete the old key before importing the new one. Do so by running the following command with administrator priviledges (On Windows, run cmd as an Administrator. On Mac/Linux prepend `sudo` to the following command):

    keytool -delete -keystore ../lib/security/cacerts -alias mykey

##### Configuring and Launching the Process Designer
1. Unzip the Process Designer zip file and all zip files within it for your platform. Beware that on Windows, unzipping the folders leads to a slightly different folder structure by default- there will be two peclient folders, one inside another. This can be 'fixed' by moving the one with the content into its parent.
2. Navigate to: `<unzipped_folder>/cpetools-<platform>/peclient/`
3. Open this folder in any text editor or IDE (ex. code .).
4. Open:
  - `shell/cpetoolenv.sh` (Linux/Mac)
  - `batch/cpetoolenv.bat` (Windows)
4. Set the `PE_CLIENT_INSTALL_DIR` to the full path of the `cpe_tools-<platform>` directory, i.e., `/Users/…/<unzipped_folder>/cpetools-linux`, beware of any spaces in the folder path.
5. Open `config/WcmApiConfig.properties`.
6. Set the `RemoteServerUrl`
  - If you access the acce console at `<host_link>/acce/`, then confirm you can access the ping page at `<host_link>/peengine/IOR/ping`

  ![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/b287ddce-8d76-44a8-a848-b01e06184755)

  - If you can get to this page, then your `RemoteServerUrl` is likely to be `<host_link>/wsi/FNCEWS40TOM`. Check that you can also reach this page. If successful, it should display an xml document like so:
  ![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/ff515d36-8ec7-4c9f-b7c9-0a3bcbf02907)


7. Open a command line utility (i.e., Terminal [Mac], cmd [Windows]).
8. Navigate (cd) to:
  - Windows: `<unzipped_folder>/cpetools-win/peclient/batch`
  - Mac/Linux: `<unzipped_folder>/cpetools-linux/peclient/shell`
9. Run:
  - Windows: `pedesigner.bat <connection_point>`
  - Mac/Linux: `sh ./pedesigner.sh <connection_point>`
10. Enter credentials used to login to the ACCE console.
11. Process Designer should open up!

## Creating Workflows

### Claim Filing & Processing

The following workflow was demonstrated and then subsequently recreated and tested in Traveler's environment. It is a sample workflow for processing a claim application. We expanded on this by triggering it via a document upload using a subscription created in the acce console, which we will also mark as an initiating attachment to automatically include it in the triggered workflow (see below).

Workflow preview:

### Using Web Services

- In order to enable pasting wsdl partner links, navigate to _View -> Configuration_:

![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/db04cbaf-6cdd-439e-9310-38b6e2d594b6)

- Right click on the connection point and click _Properties..._:

![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/bb20e3ed-ad22-4927-9bac-531eec0f55e1)

- Under _Web Services_, check _Enable Process Designer to enter WSDL links without browsing for Web services_:

![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/95c4e89d-fabc-41d0-85ec-a51fe141a1b5)

- Now you can paste links in _Workflow Properties_ under _Web Services_ in the _Partner Links_ section:

![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/29c67c90-2903-4f98-92cb-8a3d0ad3dd26)

- Next, open up the Palette Menu and check _Web Services Palette_:

![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/7a174e99-650e-4a98-8860-f368ba4eb496)

- Now you can drag in _Invoke_ and select the created _Partner Link_ as well as the desired _Operation_:

![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/719a4799-369b-4e6b-b09a-ec76c3e24a78)

Note that for web services that require SSL (ex. _https://..._), you must add a secret containing the certificate to the trusted_certificate_list in the CR.

### Initiating Attachments

Initiating attachments are attachments to Workflows that automatically get incorporated into them on upload, via a Subscription that triggers a workflow on Document Creation.

#### Creating a Subclass (optional)

If desired, you can create a subclass of an exisitng one to use as a more specific type. This can provide finer granularity when, for example, triggering workflows.


- Within the acce console, navigte to your choice of object store, go to _Classes_ under _Data Design_ and double click on a class you would like to form a subclass for. Next, click on _Actions_ and _New Class_:
![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/6374e1f9-7a2e-46ec-9ca0-5250ffdcd8ea)

- Enter a name and description:
![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/6a4aad75-72ae-46c0-8d5c-04c90fb04096)

- Click _Finish_:

![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/cc0ab9b9-380f-4701-91ec-387615d123f2)

#### Creating the Subscription
- In the acce console under your choice of object store, navigate to _Events, Actions, Processes_ and then to _Subscriptions_:
![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/a8d51fa1-55e2-4640-a5ef-68bbf59a4d1f)

- Click _New_ and enter a name and description:
![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/298624d4-42a4-4a91-a864-d9c9e89dc50f)

- Specify the class (and optionally subclass) you would like to subscribe to:
![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/714ebd0f-246e-4d54-a576-56e4bcbd45c0)

- Check _Create a workflow subscription_ to allow this subscription to trigger a workflow:
![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/e51cc792-63ef-489e-9eba-ebcdc5f723a0)

- Select the events you would like to trigger the workflow. _Creation_ of a document signifies a document upload:
![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/e3158b7a-0eeb-43a4-b50a-76f0a48d1883)

- Specify which Workflow you would like this subscription to trigger:
![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/e1b73b54-2bcf-48b8-b992-94dc940f5907)

- Optionally map properties from the uploaded document (_Property name_) to the Workflow (_Data field name_): 
![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/1c47382e-f8b2-4f32-b001-03af611448b2)

- Ensure the subscription is enabled and if you would like, include subclasses:
![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/72fdeb48-fbf6-40d8-935f-1c4fdae3ae7c)

- Review the details and click _Finish_:

![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/73330507-6e63-4524-a224-45e5cfb928ec)
![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/bb803613-3dd6-4134-8272-c40790343a2d)

#### Workflow Init Attachment

- Under _Workflow Properties_ in the _Attachments_ tab, create an attachment by double clicking under the _Name_ field, typing a name and pressing Enter:
![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/75ca2f4b-f3f5-4aec-ab24-f5c05553aed1)

- On the right sidebar, mark this as the _Initiating attachment_ by clicking the following icon, which should then appear left of the attachment name:

![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/c9a35503-02b8-44c1-bec0-7da6611ba876)
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/33d603f9-6313-4a6f-9036-10d4ad9e82e2)

- From the palette menu, drag in a component node:

![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/83dabcd3-90e6-4dbb-b881-cbce049fb45f)

- Configure this component by selecting an operation to extract information from the uploaded attachment, such as its given title, for example, which corresponds to symbolicPropName:
![](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/436100/files/320f420c-2c6d-454a-8203-4a55799f3edf)

This then populates the return value, which can be used elsewhere in the Workflow as desired
