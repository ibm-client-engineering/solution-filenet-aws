# IER UseCases

## Create an electronic record 

In IER desktop, Navigate to FPOS and create a fileplan as shown:

![FilePlan](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/cca92475-17d7-4ba7-8cfe-b097fcd75200)

Navigate to _ICN desktop_ -> _ROS_ and select a document you want to declare as record:

![Record](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/932ff6cd-5b60-4c83-8002-b6e188af883e)


Select the file plan repository as FPOS and preoperties as shown below. Click on _Declare_.

![DeclareRecord](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/15cdb8c6-365e-4ac8-93e1-c9990820aa31)

Now the selected document will have an icon as shown like below:

![RecordIcon](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/d6fcf4d7-fc75-4010-8f4f-74cf4961ac52)

IN IER desktop the selected record on above steps would be visible as Electronic Record:

## Managing Records


### Creating Dispostion Schedule

There are two distinct types of disposition schedules available for your use. Basic dispostion schedule and Advanced dispostion schedule.

A basic dispostion schedule is a record category that specifies the retention period and the retention trigger property (event).
The value of using a Basic disposition schedule is faster time to process dispositions and less complexity in defining the schedule specifics.


An Advanced disposition schedule contains the retention period, the cut off trigger event (when the clock starts ticking), record phases and disposal instructions.
An administrator can associate a disposition schedule with one or more record categories, record folders or record types.
A record folder can have its own disposition schedule, or it can inherit the disposition schedule associated with a parent record category.


In a disposition schedule, an administrator will specify the retention rules for records and instructions for disposing of records at the end of the retention period.
Disposition instructions and workflows include:

- Review

- Transfer to an archive for permanent preservation

- Export to another location

- Destroy (with approval)

- Auto-destroy

Below are the steps on how to create a dispostion schedule.

1. Navigate to IER desktop and click on Configuration Tab. Select _Advanced Dispostion Schedules_ from the dropdown:


![Dispostion](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/39827486-20a0-4584-a0ce-5eef86065f83)


2. Click _Add Dispostion Schedule_ to create a new dispostion schedule:


![AddDispostion](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/d89728ab-3e1e-40be-9e62-6b89d06bd33c)


3. Enter the properties for the dispostion schedule as shown:


![DispostionProp](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/59b49906-74de-4d6e-8262-a2913bc0033f)


4. Scroll down on dispostion schedule page. You can see the _Contract dispostion_ added like so:


![DispostionSchedule](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/a7cdeb64-4e1a-4ff3-abf6-20a621b3fc22)

5. A new dispostion schedule is successfully added to the list!



### Applying and executing disposition schedule

Disposition is normally executed on an automated schedule basis. There may be times that, as a Records Administrator, you would want to apply and execute a disposition schedule manually.
Although this is not the most common mechanism for executing a disposition schedule, it can be done if the need arises. 

1. Click on the top navigator icon on left corner and navigate to _File Plans:_


![FilePlan](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/d20f11e4-66cf-4811-8e88-78f189dab931)


2. Navigate to record category and click _Add Record Category:_

![RecordCategory](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/77320014-36ea-4fa3-a051-d853fdc12e43)


3. Fill in record category properties as shown and click _Add:_

![RecordProp](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/691b190a-7a61-4adf-abdf-73aff3ba10b4)


4. Now the records category with Date Created is visible:

![DispostionInstruction](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/79cc265e-25b7-4be9-afd2-571eeb7aff85)

5. Re-classify previous manually declared record to new Record category; under _Actions_, select _Move:_

![Classifyrecord](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/14e93a1b-a4bf-4f46-93aa-0055b36700ff)

Enter _2023 Compliance Rule_, the new record category, and click _Move:_

![MoveRecord](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/d61b1f41-946f-4315-ba19-1fd8a3e69e86)

Here is an example under record category:

![RecordMoved](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/26e81b8c-e718-41f9-9e7d-6c6eb1e6a381)


6. Now we can run the dispostion sweep to prepare the above record category for dispostion. 

On top left Navigator click on _Tasks_ and then on _Schedule_ > _Schedule Basic Dispostion Sweep:_


![DispostionSweep](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/9bb0887a-292e-4aa3-a16f-1612f3812b67)


Select FPOS, fill in the details as shown, and click _Schedule Sweep:_


![FPOS](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/4e3ff62b-08a5-40da-98a8-18f727e19ac0)


![ScheduleSweep](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/cd7c19e6-7fa3-4200-955f-71bd6ace6e0e)

You will see the scheduled sweep with a status of `Scheduled` and then `In Progress`. Refresh until you see it shows `Completed`.


![DispostionSchedule](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/98bf60c6-1af1-4fa5-b29b-eb8e910d68d9)
