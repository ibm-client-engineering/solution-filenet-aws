We thought this was due to the host name being in the wrong location in the YAML file, but it was actually due to the route 53 external DNS operator taking some time to pick everything up.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned<a href="#lessons-learned" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Lessons Learned" title="Direct link to Lessons Learned">â€‹</a></h2><ul><li>Operator deployment takes care of requesting resources for new containers. Operator deployment creates an initialization container that spins up and it does not have the ability to set up CPU and memory limits. In the future, managing resources in environment can take care of this issue.</li><li>When applying the Ingress, give the route 53 DNS operator time to pick up the correct host name before trying to access it through the browser.</li><li>When accessing the host, we need to create a certificate to give it a secure connection.

However, we acknowledged that each environment is unique and may require specific considerations. For instance, the customer was already utilizing Kynverno as a cluster policy manager.</p></li><li><p><strong>Private Registry</strong>: To ensure smooth integration, we worked with the customer to identify all the necessary images for FileNet, including Postgres and OpenLDAP. This information was crucial for them to pre-stage their private repository since external traffic was not permitted in their cluster. <a href="https://github.ibm.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/issues/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See #6</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Cluster Privileges</strong>: A collaborative approach required us to determine the cluster privileges available to the customer within their environment. By understanding their permissions, we could effectively align our efforts and ensure seamless integration.</p></li><li><p><strong>Resource Quota</strong> : As part of our combined efforts, we recognized that the cluster was created through an automated process, which automatically assigned namespace resource quotas. This allowed us to optimize resource allocation and ensure efficient usage within the shared environment. <a href="https://github.ibm.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/issues/8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See #8</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Operator Image</strong>: During our collaboration, we encountered a blocker in the customer's environment where the default image did not set resource quotas for temporary job containers. Working with the internal dev team we were able to get a hotfix in place for the operator image. <a href="https://github.ibm.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/issues/9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See #9</a> and <a href="https://ibm-analytics.slack.com/archives/CSKA33AV6/p1682650781798569" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Development Collaboration Slack Thread</a> also referenced <a href="https://github.ibm.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/issues/8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See #8</a></p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned<a href="#lessons-learned" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Lessons Learned" title="Direct link to Lessons Learned">â€‹</a></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Empowering Education</strong>: A key aspect of our collaborative approach was to provide the customer with valuable resources to empower themselves. We shared links that enabled them to proactively learn about Kubernetes, AWS, and even utilize an AWS Sandbox for hands-on practice. This proactive learning approach set a strong foundation and allowed us to make significant progress upon our onsite engagement.</p></li><li><p><strong>Comprehensive Cluster Privilege Guidance</strong>: While working together, we recognized that certain privileges were necessary for a smooth installation of the FileNet operator. To ensure a seamless experience for future customers, we took the initiative to identify and compile a comprehensive list of required cluster privileges. By sharing this list, we aimed to minimize any potential roadblocks and foster a more efficient onsite collaboration.</p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="action-items">Action Items<a href="#action-items" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Action Items" title="Direct link to Action Items">â€‹</a></h2><ul><li><strong>ReadOnlyRootFileSystem</strong> - FCN 5.5.10 has readOnlyRootFilesystem implemented as part of security improvements applied to the container image. This causes problems as the customer uses Dynatrace in their environment and these folders cannot be copied thus causing the setup jobs to fail when deploying the FileNet pods. For now we are asking the customer to disable Dynatrace. <a href="https://github.ibm.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/issues/8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See #8</a></li><li><strong>RFE to be opened</strong> - <a href="https://dba.ideas.ibm.com/ideas/CSFN-I-167" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSFN-I-167</a></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="up-next">Up Next<a href="#up-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Up Next" title="Direct link to Up Next">â€‹</a></h2><ul><li>Successfully deploying the CR to the FileNet operator <a href="https://github.ibm.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/issues/8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See #8</a></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="metrics">Metrics<a href="#metrics" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Metrics" title="Direct link to Metrics">â€‹</a></h2><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="notes">Notes<a href="#notes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Notes" title="Direct link to Notes">â€‹</a></h2><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tracking">Tracking<a href="#tracking" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Tracking" title="Direct link to Tracking">â€‹</a></h2>]]></content:encoded>
